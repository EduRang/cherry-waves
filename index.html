  A sea of waves we hug the same plank<br></br>
(Saw your end)<br></br>
Just as I'd rehearsed over in my brain<br></br>
(Saw your end)<br></br>
The waves suck you in and you drown<br></br>
If like, you should sink down beneath<br></br>
I'll swim down, would you?<br></br>
You?<br></br>
You hang the anchors over my neck<br></br>
(Saw your end)<br></br>
I liked it at first but the more you laughed<br></br>
The crazier I came<br></br>
The waves suck you in then you drown<br></br>
If like, you'd just stay down with me<br></br>
I'll swim down with you<br></br>
Is that what you want?<br></br>
You<br></br>
Is that what you want?<br></br>
Wave<br></br>
Wave<br></br>
Inside<br></br>
If like, you should stay down beneath<br></br>
I'll swim down<br></br>
Would you?<br></br>
Is that what you want?<br></br>
Would you?<br></br>
Is that what you want?<br></br>
With you?<br></br>
You<br></br>
